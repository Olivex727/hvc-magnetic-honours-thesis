I would like to thank my primary and secondary supervisors, Dr. Craig Anderson and Prof. Naomi-McClure Griffiths for being the main body of support, data, and ideas when writing this thesis. I would also like to acknowledge Prof. Bryan Gaensler and Dr. Lyla Jung for providing further aid in the process of analysis, and their support in regards to POSSUM itself. The ASKAP POSSUM team more broadly has come as a great aid and source of community during the production of this thesis.

Fellow radio astronomer Callum Lynn has also been a great source of advice and help in constructing this thesis for a more general astronomical audience, along with his guidance about the honours and PhD process.

The ANU SSN Consultancy Group was a crucial part in the validation of the statistical techniques listed in this paper, including the suggestion to use the Weighted ANOVA and Tukey HSD test.
