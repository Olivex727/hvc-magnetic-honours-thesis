\chapter{Analysis and Results}
\label{cha:derivation}

In constructing an algorithm to detect the signature of, and to further calculate the strength magnetic draping in HVCs, as in section \ref{sec:outline}, it is important to pay attention to the validity of the methods being employed, as there has been no well-established precedent for doing so on large samples of HVCs.

\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

Due to the significant limitations in available data, the use of assumptions, both physical and observational, is necessary to lay the groundwork for increasingly robust analysis. Without assumptions, it becomes difficult to construct methods for the detection and estimation of magnetic fields. Hence, the four primary assumptions below allow for formation of a working method, with the explicit description meant to point to how the method to be improved.


The first major assumption is that the ionisation fraction of the Galactic halo is approximately constant, i.e. gas in the halo is well-mixed. This does not account for major sources of heterogeneity caused by HVCs (a desired outcome) or other ionised regions such as the Magellanic Clouds (an undesired outcome).


Simulation data can be used to analyse the problematic nature of assuming a constant ionisation fraction \citep{ID23}. However, it is difficult to apply simulation data to observational data due to the amount of variables that need to be controlled for. Similar to the method employed in \cite{ID23}, it will be assumed that the ionisation fraction is high and constant.


The second major assumption is that the weighted average of the HI column density on a HVC is linearly proportional to, and biased towards the peak column density in the centre of the HVC. This is an approximation that aims to simplify calculations to the analysis of a single data point provided in the Moss catalogue. A more complex estimation of average HI column density requires a significantly more in-depth analysis. HI column density is certainly not uniform within clouds, as mentioned in \cite{ID69}. It also neccessitates some level of correlation between line-of-sight magnetic fields and their uncertainties (a consequence of Poisson noise).


Both above assumptions sacrifice accuracy for simplicity, and is allowable primarily due to the method of calculation explained by \cite{ID27} and in section \ref{sec:los_dev}. In this report, the simplicity does not disqualify the results of the investigation, but it does remove its ability to be definitive. The result of applying both assumptions is that the line-of-sight magnetic field strength is linearly proportional to the faraday depth with a scaling constant unique to each HVC – as demonstrated in later section \ref{sec:los_dev}.


The third core assumption is an observational one instead of a physical one. It is that HVCs can be represented by a circular region in the sky. Allowing for methods to distinguish between the surrounding backgrounds and HVC RM grids. As seen from the HI plots in figure \ref{fig:all_hvcs}, this assumption appears to only be correct in particular cases. But do note that the HI background discriminates for high-VLSR HI emission. The HI background is a visual tool, and it cannot be used as a one-to-one tracer of ionised gas.


All three assumptions additionally meet the desired goal of creating method that can adapted and refined for future use. As discussed in sections \ref{ssec:B2} and \ref{cha:conclusion}, these three assumptions can be dropped in the presence of more detailed data or more rigorous methodologies manipulated from the one described in this paper.


Lastly, a very typical assumption made is that the RM contribution along a line of sight is added along said line of sight. This is not necessarily correct; however, it is a fair assumption that most past literature has made to deconstruct equation \ref{eq:rm_integral} \citep{ID27, ID3, ID26}. This makes the fourth assumption.

Each HVC image includes the centre and the chosen $\delta x$ value as discussed in section \ref{sec:KStest}.}

    \label{fig:all_hvcs_avg}
\end{figure}

\section{Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) Testing}
\label{sec:KStest}

Before estimating the strength of the magnetic draping signature on HVCs, it is important to first confirm that there is a detectable magnetic field to analyse. To do this, the KS test was employed. The set of RM grid points for each HVC collated in section \ref{ssec:hvc_snapshot} include any grid point within $2\delta x$ degrees of the HVC centre, where $\delta x$ is the HVC angular diameter, the average value between the Moss catalogue's 'dx' and 'dy' values (i.e. its cartesian dimensions), shown in appendix table \ref{tab:moss_hvcs} and in figure \ref{fig:all_hvcs}. Employing assumption three, two separate populations can be formed by delineating RMs inside and outside a distance $\delta x$ from the HVC centre. All sampling points within the defined circle makes the “HVC RMs” population, and the ones outside the circle makes the “Background RMs” population.


A two-sample, two-tailed, KS test was performed comparing both the background and HVC RM distributions. A critical p-value of 0.001 was assumed to determine if a significant magnetic field was detected. This would correspond to 99.9\% significance of difference. Table \ref{tab:KStest} shows the KS test results applied to each HVC. Out of the 13 HVCs tested, 10 HVCs (77\%) had a significant difference between both populations in the corrected RM case.


For uncorrected RMs, the KS test determined that 12 HVCs had a significant difference between both populations. No HVC had both a significant detection for the uncorrected case and a non-significant detection for the corrected case. This implies that using the corrected RMs makes the KS test more selective. The use of the Hutschenreuter map is justified as it means false positives are less likely to appear.


There appears to be a moderate correlation between the KS statistic and the absolute Galactic lattitude for each HVC, with a calculated $R^2$ statistic of 0.6039. When determening correlation with respect to p-value instead of KS statistic, the $R^2$ statistic drops to 0.4489. The KS test does not appear to be correlated with VLSR or VGSR, having an $R^2$ statistic of 0.03023 and 0.008367 respectively.

\section{Derivation of Line-of-Sight Magnetic Fields}
\label{sec:los_dev}

As from equation \ref{eq:rm_integral}, there is a relationship between the line-of-sight magnetic field and the faraday depth. By removing foreground contributions to the faraday depth, one can isolate the specific contribution of the line-of-sight magnetic field made by the HVC. At the same time, the fourth assumption can be used to solve the integral in equation \ref{eq:rm_integral}, resulting as follows \citep{ID26}:


\begin{equation}
    \frac{\left<B_{\parallel}\right>}{\mu\mathrm{G}}=\frac{\left<\Phi_{\mathrm{cor}}\right>}{0.81\left<n_e\right>L_{H^+}}
\label{eq:B_intermediate}
\end{equation}


Where $\left<B_{\parallel}\right>$ is the average line-of-sight magnetic field in \textmu G, $\Phi_{\mathrm{cor}}$ is the corrected faraday depth in $\mathrm{rad m}^{-2}$, $n_e$ is the electron density in $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, and $L_{H^+}$ is the HVC path length in pc. From this equation, \cite{ID27} derives a simplified equation that eliminates the need to calculate the electron density and path length:


\begin{equation}
    \frac{B_{\parallel}}{\mu\mathrm{G}}=3.80\times10^{18}\frac{\Phi_{\mathrm{cor}}}{X\left<N_{HI}\right>}
\label{eq:the_equation}
\end{equation}


Where $X$ is the unitless ionisation fraction, and $\left<N_{HI}\right>$ is the weighted average HI column density over the region being analysed, measured in $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. This equation can only be derived under the first assumption. Additionally, the use of the average HI column density is intrinsically tied to the second assumption.


Applying both assumptions one and two and utilizing this equation demonstrates that the line-of-sight magnetic field is linearly proportional to the faraday depth. Thus, an RM denoting the singular faraday depth associated with any given HVC, and any given background surrounding the HVC. These two RM values can be subtracted from each other and converted into a magnetic field via multiplication of a constant factor to create what is refered to as the 'master RM'.


Despite the detailed analysis conducted in section \ref{cha:FR}, it was decided that the non-altered interpolated sky map be used to correct RM contributions. This is due to most already-existing literature relying on interpolations. From figure \ref{fig:anisotropy}, which displays histograms of the corrected and uncorrected line-of-sight magnetic field points surrounding HVCs, it is demonstrated that the Hutschenreuter map can remove the anisotropy of the ISM by turning an uncorrected bimodal symmetric distribution into a normal distribution centred at zero. However, it also is apparent that the correction can introduce a significantly higher variance in the data, shown in the t-distribution form of the corrected RMs in figure \ref{fig:anisotropy}.

Figure \ref{fig:all_hvcs}, presents HI images of all 13 HVCs, the overlapping RM grids, and the cropped HI fields. The filtered Moss catalogue, including all 13 HVCs is displayed in appendix \ref{sec:appendixB}. It is apparent that once the foreground is removed, ridge-like structures appear in the data which may correspond to turbulent mixing of gas in the halo \citep{ID69, ID30}.

\section{Mathematical methods to evaluate HVC Magnetic Fields}
\label{sec:evaluation}

It is highly important to seperate the techniques performed in this section as opposed to the detection method outlined in section \ref{sec:KStest}. A faliure of the methods described here to significantly determine the strength of the magnetic fields does not imply a faliure in detection of a magnetic draping signature. This is further elaborated in the discussion section \ref{ssec:B3}. This is important to point out given the size of the uncertainties in table \ref{tab:Bdev} being large enough to reasonably have a magnetic field value of zero.


For the HVCs which did have detectable magnetic fields, the next step is to estimate the strength of the magnetic field draping over each HVC. Previous analyses of the Smith Cloud, such as in \cite{ID5, ID26}, utilises a weighted average of RMs to obtain the 'Master RM'. This may not be transferable to a generalised algorithm. While the background RM population will generally follow the expected normal distribution, the in-HVC population distributions can vary depending on the orientation of the HVC with respect to the observer. For more face-on HVCs, RMs may form a ring of RM values ranging from positive to negative around the ring, resulting in a zero weighted average. These can also be refered to as 'coffee stain' RM fields.


In \cite{ID5, ID26}, due to analysing one single and large object, it is possible to divide the object into several smaller sections for analysis. It is not possible to do this especially given the limitations created by assumption three.


The more complex HVC RM distribution combined with the oversimplified spherical morphological model means that using a weighted average may underestimate strengths - the same applies to most forms of modal analysis including gaussian fitting i.e. any method that can not account for antimodal or multimodal analysis. This report proposes two new methods to determine the magnetic field strength surrounding HVCs under the simplified spherical morphological model, which can overcome the potential issues with the weighted average. Sections \ref{ssec:KS_EDF} and \ref{ssec:sigma_sub} attempts to justify the mathematical validity of these two methods, and section \ref{sec:results} shows both the results of using these methods, with some further post-hoc justifications demonstrated via statistical analysis in \ref{ssec:results_stats}.


Despite the potential shortfalls of the weighted average, it is a method that is sanctioned by literature and is still a valid method to use and compare other methods to. It is only an important limitation to pay attention to in the analysis of HVCs.


\subsection{KS-EDF Method}
\label{ssec:KS_EDF}

The first proposed method relies on both the results of the KS test and the Empirical Distribution Functions (EDFs) of the in-HVC and out-HVC populations required to evaluate the KS statistic. The x-axis location of the KS statistic is where the distribution of the two populations differs the greatest. And thus, it is not unreasonable to state that the magnetic field strength corresponds to this location in some manner. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:KSdiff}, where the red line denotes the KS statistic's length and x-axis position.


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{"KS_diff.png"}
    \centering
    \caption{A diagram representing the physical intuition of the KS-EDF method. The graph shows the EDFs of inside and outside populations for an example HVC. The lines drawn on the diagram represent the statistic value and the KS-EDF 'master RM' value.}
    \label{fig:KSdiff}
\end{figure}

The second step in this method is to further remove background interference as explained in section \ref{sec:los_dev}. This can be done by finding the x-axis location at which the density in the background population EDF equals that of the density of the HVC population EDF at the KS-derived x-axis location. This step has the effect of removing any potential deviation from zero that the magnetic field in the background has due the ridge-like structures, which will appear in the EDF as either (i) any deviation from a standard normal distribution, or (ii) a deviation from the centre of the normal distribution as a function of its uncertainty.


This is shown in figure \ref{fig:KSdiff} with the black line – the length of the black line representing the final assessed magnetic field value. In this case, the background population in orange is approximately normal. So, case (ii) from the paragraph above is demonstrated.


The second step is not always valid, as RM values can vary due to turbulence, creating an inherent variability in the EDFs. Hence the necessity of further statistical analysis.


\subsection{Uncertainy Subtraction}
\label{ssec:sigma_sub}

A more legitimate method involves the reverse-propagation of uncertainties. An assumption can be made that for some HVCs, there is an inherent variation in the magnetic field as one looks at different locations in the defined morphological circle, appearing as the afformentioned 'coffee stain' shape. This inherent variance is denoted as $\sigma_{\mathrm{true}}^2$.


Additionally, each RM measurement comes with a measurement uncertainty, denoted as $\sigma_{\mathrm{meas.}}$. Propagating these two uncertainties would give what should be the observed variance, $\sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}^2$:


\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\mathrm{obs}}^2 = \sigma_{\mathrm{true}}^2 + \sigma_{\mathrm{meas.}}^2
\label{eq:var_sub_1}
\end{equation}


The observed uncertainty can be calculated by taking the statistical standard deviation of the population, and the measurement uncertainty can be averaged to give a whole-population measurement uncertainty approximation. This allows for equation \ref{eq:var_sub_1} can be reversed to derive the 'true' variance in the RM population:


\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\mathrm{true}} = \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}\left(\mathrm{RM}\right) - {\left<\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}\right>}^2}
\label{eq:var_sub_2}
\end{equation}


By definition of standard deviation, the corresponding true variance can be approximated as average separation between RMs in the population, thus quantifying the inherent variation in the HVC magnetic field, i.e. the magnetic field strength.


The same can be done to the background population, instead to detect the potential interferences of the ridge-like structures of the halo magnetic field. This can be used to subtract out the background interferences that were included in the derivation of the true in-HVC variance.


A clear potential source of error in this method comes in the fact that the standard deviation is positive, affecting the validity in two separate ways: (i) cases where the average measurement uncertainty is larger than the statistical standard deviation, resulting in a complex uncertainty; (ii) cases where the line-of-sight magnetic field strength \textit{should} be negative but is calculated as positive (before the true background variance is subtracted) i.e. the field vectors point away from the telescope. Case (i) does not invalidate the method outright but does mean that 'bad data' might have to be thrown out. This happened in only one case as seen in section \ref{sec:results}. Case (ii) is irrelevant in the conclusion, as the parity of the magnetic field is not a factor being analysed. However, the if the main concern is if the background and HVC true variances differ in sign. This is not of concern because if there is a sign difference, the background ridge-like structures would cancel-out the presence of HVC magnetic fields, resulting in every invalidating occurrence of case (ii) necessarily leading to case (i).


To reiterate, the caveats and assumptions described in this derivation may appear as mathematically or intuitively valid, however it is worthwhile to test things via statistical analysis and modelling (see chapter \ref{cha:conclusion}).

The results of each method are compiled in table \ref{tab:Bdev}.

    \label{tab:Bdev}
\end{table}


The distributions of the results are displayed in the boxplots of figure \ref{fig:BBox}. The Smith Cloud magnetic field as discussed in section \ref{sec:sc} is marked with a red line, and the upper bound as discussed by the \citeauthor{ID23} simulations in section \ref{ssec:draping} is marked in blue. Both values at 8 and 3 {\textmu}G respectively act as suggested upper bounds for the strength of these HVCs.


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"B_Boxplots.png"}
    \centering
    \caption{A boxplot representing the absolute-value magnetic field of each HVC for both derivational methods. The red and blue dotted lines indicate two predicted upper bounds, one set by the \citeauthor{ID23} simulations, and the other by the Smith Cloud respectively. Displayed is the mean (green triangle) and median (orange line) for each method of evaluation.}
    \label{fig:BBox}
\end{figure}


From figure \ref{fig:BBox}, the magnetic field strengths are overall higher compared to the hypothesised estimate of being on the order of magnitude of 0.1 {\textmu}G from the \citeauthor{ID23} simulations. The three methods appear to visually agree with each other approximately, with the KS-EDF having a generally higher estimate for the magnetic field value, the Variance Subtraction having the greatest spread, and the Weighted Average having the largest tail. It is important to note that due to the logarithmic scale used, the mean is inherently biased to visually appear at higher values. However, the use of a logarithmic scale is still justified due to the order-of-magnitude levels of error.

\subsection{Uncertainties}
\label{ssec:results_uncertainties}

With each method comes a unique derivation of uncertainties. The uncertainty in the weighted mean is given as trivial – calculated separately for the HVC and background populations, and then propagated. When calculating RM uncertainties, an intrinsic uncertainty of 7 $\mathrm{rad m}^{-2}$ must be added. This value comes from \cite{ID21}, being the extragalactic radio source scatter post-correction.


The uncertainty in the KS-EDF statistic reflects the inherent variability in the method and is calculated by the Euclidean addition of the average measurement uncertainty of both the HVC and background populations. This corresponds to the propagation of RM uncertainties shown in figure \ref{fig:KSdiff}, where the black line considered to vary as the EDF varies in shape from resampling. The uncertainty in the variance subtraction method was estimated via bootstrap resampling with replacement. The number of samples generated per population is equal to the size of the population being analysed. Once the HVC and background population uncertainties were evaluated, the two uncertainties were propagated to produce the listed result.

Note that when uncertainties are greater than the magnetic field values, as seen in table \ref{tab:Bdev}, it does not mean the detection is invalid, but that the stated method cannot confidently estimate the field strength. This comes back to the understanding that the assumptions greatly decreases precision, but that these values can be improved.

\subsection{Statistical Comparison of Methods}
\label{ssec:results_stats}

Two statistical tests were used to compare the three methods' derived magnetic field values (instead of master RM values, which is linearly proportional to the magnetic field value due to assumption 2). A weighted ANOVA test was employed as it can compare multiple methods against each other, with the weights allowing for the accounting of uncertainties. The F-Statistic calculated from the weighted ANOVA test was 3.375, with a corresponding p-value of 0.0388, meaning there is only a 95\% confidence interval of similarity, but is still fairly weak. See appendix \ref{sec:appendixE} for further detail.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l}
        \hline

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A table describing the Tukey Multiple Comparison of Means test results for the HVCs with magnetic field detection.}
    \label{tab:tukey_hsd}
\end{table}

The weighted ANOVA test results were also fed into a Tukey multiple comparisons of means test. The results of this test are shown in table \ref{tab:tukey_hsd}. Note that here, the p-value is a measure of the likelihood that the two data sets are different. It is clear that an alternative hypothesis, that two given distributions are different, is not met to 95\% confidence in all cases except when comparing the weighted mean and KS-EDF method. However it is clear that the KS-EDF method does not match well with the other two cases in-general. To better quantify the agreement between the weighted mean and variance subtraction methods, a reduced chi-squared statistic was calculated using independent propagation of uncertainties. The resulting reduced chi-squared statistic was 1.088 - which is very close to the ideal value of unity.


The reason for the weighted ANOVA test as a whole giving a weak significance of similarity compared to only one of three values in the Tukey test giving strong evidence of similarity, is due to the ability of the weighted ANOVA test to 'bridge the gaps' created by two data points with no overlapping uncertainties and a third data point in the centre. This is why a three-way comparison is needed. The primary three sources for the weighted ANOVA and Tukey test is provided in the papers by \cite{ID76, ID77, ID78}.
